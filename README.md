# Real_Time_Chat
Don't forget to hit npm install in terminal to install dependencies for both frontend and backend 
Backend is well-organized and maintained as it handles :
USER AUTHORIZATION & AUTHINTICATION
LIMITED USER ACCESSIBILITY
REALTIME CHATTING WITH OTHER USERS

Frontend is working well but have some issues with chatting container ,, i just made it to show
how backend is correctly working
